# typescript-deafualt-config

just my deafualt setup for type script devolopment (on linux)

u can fork this and use this too if you want

or if you want to use my version run

`git clone https://github.com/Angus1811/typescript-config.git`


## errors

if this fails you might have to create your own "ts" direcotry in the "src folder"
